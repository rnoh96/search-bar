# Search Bar
A simple search bar with minimal styling

  

## Lessons Learned
There was no completely "new" for me in this project. Nothing really exciting here, but I believe it was a great review for me. Especially when it comes to ".toLowerCase()" or ".toUpperCase()". I sometimes forget how useful these functions/methods are.



## Deployment
Deployed with Google Firebase.



## Get Started
From command line, first clone this repo:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rnoh96/search-bar.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd search-bar

# Go into the public folder
$ cd public
```

Once you are in the correct folder:
``` bash
# Open the html file in default browser
$ open index.html
```

You should now see a working webpage.
